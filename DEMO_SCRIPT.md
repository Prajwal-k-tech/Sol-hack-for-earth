## 📝 Demo Flow

### 1. **Problem Introduction** (30 seconds)
> "Traditional solar farm maintenance is reactive and inefficient. Operators know panels are dirty, but they don't know WHEN to clean them or HOW to clean them efficiently."

**Show**: Point to red (dirty) panels scattered across the satellite map
- **Visual**: 300+ panel markers on real satellite imagery
- **Key Point**: 5,000 panels need cleaning = massive opportunity cost

### 2. **Our Solution - AI Prediction** (60 seconds)
> "Sol-AI Planner doesn't just detect problems - it predicts them. Our AI model achieves 92.5% accuracy in soiling prediction."

**Demo Steps**:
1. Point to "AI Soiling Prediction" chart
2. Highlight 7-day forecast with color-coded risk levels
3. Show weather integration: "Dust storm expected tomorrow"
4. **Call out**: "Day 4 shows 60% soiling - that's when we need to act"

**Key Metrics to Mention**:
- 92.5% AI prediction accuracy
- Weather-integrated forecasting
- Proactive alerts before efficiency loss

### 3. **The Magic - Route Optimization** (90 seconds)
> "But prediction is only half the battle. The real innovation is our TSP-optimized drone routing."

**Demo Steps**:
1. Click "Optimize Cleaning Route" button
2. **Wait for loading animation** (builds suspense)
3. Show results screen with dramatic numbers:
   - **47% time reduction** (164 min → 87 min)
   - **52% battery savings** (85% → 41% usage)
   - **₹19,656 cost savings** per cycle

**Visual Impact**: 
- Animated blue route overlay on satellite map
- Before/after comparison metrics
- Real-time algorithm visualization

### 4. **Technical Deep-dive** (45 seconds)
> "Under the hood, we're running Genetic Algorithm + 2-opt optimization with 1,000 iterations in just 2.3 seconds."

**Show**:
- Algorithm details panel
- TSP problem complexity for 50+ panels
- Live performance metrics

### 5. **Business Impact** (45 seconds)
> "For a 50MW solar farm, this translates to massive ROI."

**Key Numbers**:
- Daily CO₂ savings: 42.3 tons
- Trees equivalent: 1,847 trees planted
- Daily energy: 245.8 MWh
- Market opportunity: 10MW-200MW installations (underserved segment)

### 6. **Real-time Capabilities** (30 seconds)
**Demo**:
1. Click on individual panel markers
2. Show detailed panel information popup
3. Highlight real-time status monitoring
4. Weather alerts and notification system

## 🚨 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does this scale to larger farms?"**
A: "Our TSP algorithm handles 1000+ panels. For enterprise farms, we distribute optimization across multiple drone fleets."

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage?"**
A: "We're the only platform combining AI prediction WITH route optimization. Competitors do one or the other, not both."

**Q: "How accurate is the weather integration?"**
A: "We integrate with multiple weather APIs and IoT sensors. Our PM2.5 monitoring shows immediate impact on soiling rates."

**Q: "What about cloudy days for cleaning?"**
A: "Actually optimal - dust settles better, less thermal stress on panels. Our AI factors this into scheduling."

**Q: "Business model?"**
A: "SaaS subscription: ₹2-5 per panel per month. ROI achieved in 3-6 months through efficiency gains."
