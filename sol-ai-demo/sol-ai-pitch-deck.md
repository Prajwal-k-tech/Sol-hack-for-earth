## Slide 1: The Problem
### Solar O&M Crisis: $13B Market Running Inefficiently

**Current Challenges:**
- Solar panels lose 15-25% efficiency due to soiling
- Reactive maintenance approach wastes time and resources
- Drone cleaning missions are inefficient and battery-draining
- 70% of installations (<100MW) are underserved by enterprise solutions

**The Gap:** Existing solutions are diagnostic-only. They tell you *what's* dirty, not *how* to clean it efficiently.

---

## Slide 2: Market Opportunity
### Massive Growth in Underserved Segments

**Market Size:**
- Drone solar inspection market: $1.2B → $6.8B by 2032 (24.21% CAGR)
- Solar panel cleaning market growing at 15%+ annually
- 70% of solar installations are under 100MW - underserved by enterprise solutions

**Target Market:**
- Small-to-medium solar installations (10MW-100MW)
- Community solar projects
- Commercial rooftop installations
- Rural and remote solar farms

---
